## Detailed Description  
This is a toolset to simulate electric vehicles operating in minigrids for rural electrification in emerging economies such as sub-saharan
Africa and optimize component sizes to show least-cost and/or least-emission options. It models a stand-alone minigrid using graph-based
representation, generates a pyomo model and hands it to a solver. Results are summarized in the

## Requirements  
This tool was designed to run under Windows 10. While portability was built in, other operating systems are untested.

#### Environment
The tool was developed using Python 3.10.6, which is recommended to use with a clean virtual environment to start with.
All required packages are listed in ```requirements.txt``` and can be installed by entering  
```pip install -r requirements.txt```  
into a terminal for the correct environment.

#### MILP Solver
The toolset is distributed with the open-source CBC solver for mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems by 
default. All other solvers supported by pyomo are also applicable in it. While CBC does work flawlessly, the commercial
Gurobi solver enables a significant speed advantage, especially when working with a large number of enabled system
blocks or long term simulation. It is available at https://www.gurobi.com/ with a free academic license model.
